# Speech-Emotion-Recognition

Introduction

This project aims to recognize human emotions and affective states from speech using deep learning techniques. We are utilizing the Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song (RAVDESS) as our primary data source. By analyzing speech audio, we can classify emotions such as calm, happy, sad, angry, fearful, surprise, and disgust expressions, along with different levels of emotional intensity.

About SER

Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is the process of identifying human emotions and affective states from speech signals. This is achieved by analyzing voice features such as tone and pitch. Animals like dogs and horses also use this phenomenon to understand human emotions.

Why We Need SER

Emotion recognition is becoming increasingly important in various fields. Here are some of the reasons why SER is essential:

Call Center Applications: SER is used in call centers to classify calls based on emotions. This helps in assessing customer satisfaction and identifying unsatisfied customers, which can lead to improvements in customer service.

Conversational Analysis: SER can be a performance parameter for conversational analysis, aiding in understanding the emotional context of conversations.

Driver Safety: In-car systems can use SER to assess the mental state of the driver. This information can be used to enhance safety by preventing accidents caused by drowsy or emotionally distressed drivers.

About the Dataset

We are using the Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song (RAVDESS) for this project. The dataset contains 1440 speech audio files with various emotions and emotional intensities, performed by 24 professional actors with a neutral North American accent.

File Naming Convention

Each file in the RAVDESS dataset has a unique filename that provides information about the stimulus characteristics. The filename follows a 7-part numerical identifier, including details such as modality, vocal channel, emotion, emotional intensity, statement, repetition, and actor.

For example, 03-01-06-01-02-01-12.wav represents an audio-only speech file, conveying the emotion of fear at normal intensity, using the statement "dogs," and spoken by the 12th actor (a female).
